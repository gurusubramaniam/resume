                With over 18 years of experience in software engineering and
                development, I've transitioned from hands-on coding to leading
                global teams, fostering high-performance, empowered groups that
                drive innovation and deliver large-scale digital solutions
                across fintech, healthcare, and leadership coaching platforms.

                I have deep expertise in fintech, having led engineering teams
                at PayPal and Greenlight Financial Technology, where I built and
                scaled secure, compliant, and high-performance financial systems
                that served millions of users worldwide. In healthcare tech, I
                worked at Hyphen, architecting distributed systems to support
                community health program management. Currently, at Torch.io, I
                lead teams in developing 1:1 and group coaching platforms that
                empower leaders and organizations to grow.

                What truly drives me is building strong, collaborative teams and
                fostering a culture where engineers thrive. I believe that
                people are the heart of technology, and my leadership philosophy
                centers on mentorship, transparency, and creating opportunities
                for growth. By aligning personal success with business success,
                I help teams build great products and grow as professionals and
                leaders.
