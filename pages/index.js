                I've spent over 15 years in the world of software engineering
                and development. My journey has taken me from hands-on coding to
                leading global teams in creating innovative, large-scale digital
                solutions. I'm passionate about cloud architecture and
                user-focused design, and I believe in using these tools to drive
                business growth and create meaningful user experiences. As a
                leader, I prioritize empathy, collaboration, and transparent
                communication to build high-performing teams that deliver
                results. Whether I'm reimagining a complex system or launching a
                new product, my goal is always the same: to make a positive
                impact in the tech world. When I'm not working, you'll often
                find me diving into DIY IoT projects, experimenting with
                Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU modules, or even indulging in a bit of
                home renovation and gardening. I'm always exploring new ways to
                blend my technical skills with my creative interests. I'm
                excited to connect with you and explore how we can create
                something remarkable together.
